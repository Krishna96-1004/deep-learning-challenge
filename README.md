# deep-learning-challenge

## Overview

This project involves creating a model to predict the success of organizations applying for funding from Alphabet Soup. We built a deep learning model to predict if organizations will use their funding effectively. The model uses various features from a dataset to make these predictions.

### Step 1: Preprocess the Data
### Step 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
### Step 3: Optimize the Model

### The following are the notebook files:
Starter_Code.ipynb
AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb

### The Following are the models generated:
Model_1.h5
AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5

## Results
The deep learning model we made did a good job at predicting if an organization would use their funding effectively with approximately 78% accuracy. We were able to achieve this by cleaning up the data, choosing the right model architecture, and fine-tuning some things along the way. The model was able to create a reliable tool to make informed decisions on effectively allocating the organization funding.
